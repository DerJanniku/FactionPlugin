# Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the development of a Minecraft faction plugin, covering foundational mechanics, advanced gameplay features, and future expansions aimed at enhancing player interaction and competitive elements.

## Phase 1: Core Systems Development

### 1. Player Customization System
- **Classes**: Implement a balanced system of player classes, each with distinct abilities (e.g., Warrior, Mage, Rogue, Archer) tailored to provide unique strengths without creating overpowering roles. 
- **Cosmetics**: Develop a cosmetic customization system that offers purely visual enhancements (e.g., hats, capes, particle effects), unlockable through achievements or server currency to encourage engagement.
- **Profile Storage**: Use YAML or JSON to store player choices based on their UUID, making retrieval efficient and profile management easy across different server sessions.

### 2. Faction System
- **Faction Traits**: Define factions with unique traits (e.g., Avalon with magical buffs, Thalassia with water benefits), fostering strategic choice in faction membership.
- **Faction Leader Mechanic**: Set up dynamic leadership mechanics where the leader is chosen based on contributions, such as resource gathering or PvP performance, and rotate leadership weekly/monthly for fair play.

### 3. Faction Building Rules & War System
- **War Declaration**: Allow factions to declare war through a voting system, promoting collaborative decision-making. Set fixed durations (e.g., 24–48 hours) for wars to maintain server stability.
- **War Mechanics**: Define rules for territory vulnerabilities during war, with objectives such as territory capture or resource depletion.
- **Building Materials**: Create faction-specific resources needed for strategic builds, adding depth to faction infrastructure and economy.

### 4. Territory Display System
- **HUD Display**: Display current faction territories using the HUD with plugins like Scoreboard or BossBar.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Ensure territory information updates as players cross boundaries, enabling seamless gameplay.

### 5. Revival System
- **Who Can Revive?** Allow only specific roles (e.g., “Healer” class) to revive, adding tactical depth.
- **Revival Conditions**: Cost revival actions with resources like XP or valuable items to add stakes.
- **Timeouts or Penalties**: Implement time-limited revivals. Players who aren’t revived return to their base with minor penalties, encouraging team coordination.

### 6. Resource Contribution & Armor Upgrades
- **Resource Thresholds**: Define progressive goals that factions must meet to unlock upgrades.
- **Faction-wide Upgrades**: Offer upgrades like faster resource gathering, stronger defenses, or health regeneration boosts.
- **Tracking Contributions**: Track player contributions via leaderboards, rewarding active players.

### 7. Scalability & Optimization
- **Server Size**: Ensure systems are adaptable for both small (20-50 players) and large servers (100+ players).
- **Simplified Mechanics for Smaller Servers**: Consider PvP-only events for smaller servers, ensuring balanced gameplay.

## Phase 2: Advanced Mechanics and Enhanced Player Interaction

### 8. Enhanced Diplomacy & Territory Control
- **Alliances & Rivals**: Develop an alliance and rival system where factions can team up or compete, sharing resources or coordinating attacks.
- **Influence System**: Let factions extend influence over neutral territories, controlling resource nodes or strategic locations.
- **Faction Laws & Governance**: Introduce customizable faction laws, such as PvP restrictions or resource quotas, to maintain internal control.

### 9. Dynamic War & PvP Events
- **War Seasons & Objectives**: Define war seasons with specific goals (e.g., resource capture or territory control). Rewards for these seasonal goals encourage long-term engagement.
- **PvP Zone Events**: Randomly spawn PvP zones that offer exclusive loot or XP for the faction that holds it. This feature adds real-time strategy for faction PvP.

### 10. Resource & Economy Enhancements
- **Faction Economy**: Design a resource-driven economy where factions manage taxes and trade zones. Incorporate faction-specific resources to foster an inter-faction economy.
- **Faction-Specific Resources**: Create unique resources for each faction, which can only be gathered in their territories, encouraging faction specialization and trade between factions.

### 11. Player Rank & Reward System
- **Custom Ranks & Permissions**: Develop customizable ranks within factions, with permissions suited to roles like “Builder,” “Warrior,” or “Diplomat.”
- **Rewards for Contributions**: Establish a leaderboard for contributions, with rewards like exclusive cosmetics or upgraded gear for top contributors.

## Phase 3: Faction Progression and Legacy Mechanics

### 12. Faction Expansion & Legacy
- **Faction Relics & Artifacts**: Create collectible faction relics or artifacts, offering special abilities (e.g., faster healing or bonus combat strength) to factions that capture them.
- **Faction Legacy System**: Allow factions to “level up” over time through war victories or resource collection, unlocking unique faction-wide perks such as enhanced gathering speed or damage boosts.

### 13. New Content & Event System
- **Special Events**: Introduce events like faction raids, treasure hunts, or PvE boss battles, open to factions who meet certain requirements.
- **Seasonal Faction Quests**: Create seasonal quests that add goals like defeating powerful mobs or gathering rare items, with faction-wide rewards for completion.
- **Expanding the Faction Roster**: Over time, add new factions with unique traits to keep the gameplay experience fresh and competitive.

### 14. Player Housing and Base Customization
- **Personal Bases**: Allow players to have individual bases within their faction’s territory, customizable with unique decorative elements.
- **Faction Headquarters**: Develop faction HQs with special functionalities (e.g., warp points, crafting stations), encouraging faction pride and cooperation in creating a central stronghold.

### 15. Cross-Server Compatibility and Data Syncing
- **Cross-Server Functionality**: Enable cross-server faction mechanics so that factions can have a presence on multiple servers.
- **Data Syncing**: Ensure that player progress and faction status can transfer seamlessly between servers, allowing for a consistent experience.

## Next Steps
1. **Complete Phase 1**: Finalize player customization, faction traits, and basic war mechanics.
2. **Begin Phase 2**: Develop advanced mechanics, including diplomacy, economy, and player-driven ranking systems.
3. **Plan Phase 3**: Focus on faction progression, content expansions, and cross-server compatibility.
4. **Iterative Testing**: Conduct rigorous testing at the end of each phase to ensure balance, optimization, and server stability.

This roadmap provides clear guidance for each phase and ensures we’re developing in a way that meets player interests and supports server growth. Let me know if any details need refinement!
